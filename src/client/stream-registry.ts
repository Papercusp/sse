/**
 * Live SSE stream registry + per-host connection-budget warning.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (owner incident, 2026-07-26/27 — "gym runs never show up").
 * A browser engine allows a fixed number of concurrent connections PER HOST
 * (WebKit: 6, measured in-app: the 7th EventSource never leaves CONNECTING).
 * A standing SSE stream holds one of those slots for its entire life, so a page
 * with 6 standing streams has ZERO slots left and every ordinary REST fetch
 * queues forever — the UI sits on "Loading…" while the server answers the same
 * query in ~13ms. That is invisible from the server side and nearly invisible
 * from the client (no error, just a promise that never settles), which is how it
 * survived for days.
 *
 * On the packaged desktop this is masked: `/api/*` fetches and EventSource ride
 * Tauri IPC (no sockets at all). In the DEV shell there is no sidecar, so IPC is
 * unavailable and everything falls back to HTTP — the 6-slot budget is real, and
 * this registry is what makes exceeding it observable instead of mysterious.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free and cheap: a Map of live streams, a monotonic id,
 * and one throttled console warning when the count reaches the danger line. Also
 * exposed as `window.__papercuspStreams()` so an operator/agent can enumerate the
 * live streams of a running page (`tauri-agent-tools eval`) without a rebuild.

 * has to own. Freshness is instead maintained by demand: every registration
 * broadcasts a `query`, so at precisely the moments the total matters, every

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Yield on contention (WI-2141694).
 *
 * Counting the pool told us we were starving; it did not stop the starving.
 * This is the acting half — and its shape is forced by two measurements, not
 * by taste:
 *
 * 1. THE TRIGGER MUST BE PROACTIVE. Measured 2026-09-02: at the per-origin cap
 *    the next request does NOT error. No `onerror`, no timeout — it queues
 *    silently and indefinitely. There is therefore no failure event to react
 *    to, and a reactive design (retry-on-error, timeout-and-recover) would
 *    have looked correct and never fired once. We act off the budget snapshot
 *    at REGISTRATION, which is the moment the total is about to matter.
 *
 * 2. THE VICTIM MUST BE CHOSEN CROSS-REALM. Measured the same day: a realm
 *    holding ZERO streams was fully starved by streams in sibling iframes, and
 *    closing one in a CHILD realm freed the parent in 31ms. A registry that
 *    only ever yielded its own streams would sit blocked while the stream that
 *    actually needed to go lived one document over.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS MODULE NEVER PICKS A VICTIM ON ITS OWN ────────────────────────
 * `libs/generic/sse` is domain-free: it cannot know that the chat pane matters
 * more than a background poller. So a stream is yieldable ONLY if its consumer
 * passed `onYieldRequested`, and consumers rank themselves with `priority`.
 * No callback ⇒ never yielded. That default is what keeps this change
 * inert for every existing caller.
 *
 * ⚠ The visibility-pause precedent proves the pause/resume MECHANISM works; it
 * does NOT license yielding anything. Visibility-pause fires when nobody is
 * watching. A contention-yield can pause a stream the user is looking at, so
 * data arrives late on a VISIBLE pane. That asymmetry is exactly why priority
 * is load-bearing and why "just drop the oldest" is the wrong rule.
 *
 * ── ARBITRATION WITHOUT A NEGOTIATION ROUND-TRIP ───────────────────────────
 * N realms must not all yield for one contended slot. Rather than a
 * request/offer/command handshake (which needs a collection window, i.e. a
 * timer this module deliberately does not have), every realm PUBLISHES its
 * best yieldable candidate on the announce it already sends. Each realm can
 * then compute the SAME global winner from the SAME data by a total order —
 * (priority, openedAtMs, realmId) — and only the realm that owns the winner
 * acts. Ties cannot be split differently by different realms because realmId
 * makes the order total.
 *
 * The residual race is a divergent peer table, which can over-yield by one.
 * The cooldown below bounds it; hysteresis (yield at 5, invite back under 3)
 * stops a yielded stream re-registering straight into another yield.
